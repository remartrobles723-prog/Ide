## Installation

[<img src="https://github.com/Kunzisoft/Github-badge/raw/main/get-it-on-github.svg"
    alt="Get it on F-Droid"
    height="80">](https://github.com/Mohammed-baqer-null/android-code-studio/releases)

> _Please install Android Code Studio from trusted sources only i.e._
> - [_GitHub Releases_](https://github.com/Mohammed-baqer-null/android-code-studio/releases)

- Download the Android Code Studio APK from the mentioned trusted sources.
- Follow the
  instructions [here](https://docs.androidide.com/tutorials/get-started.html) to
  install the build tools.

## Limitations

- For working with projects in AndroidCodeStudio, your project must use Android Gradle Plugin v7.2.0 or
  newer. Projects with older AGP must be migrated to newer versions.
- SDK Manager is already included in Android SDK and is accessible in Android Code Studio via its Terminal.
  But, you cannot use it to install some tools (like NDK) because those tools are not built for
  Android.

The app is still being developed actively. It's in beta stage and may not be stable. if you have any
issues using the app, please let us know.
