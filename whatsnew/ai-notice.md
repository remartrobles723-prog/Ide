# 🚨 Important Notice

> Always open your files in your code editor before requesting changes. This ensures that if a response generates incorrect or corrupted code, you can easily undo the modifications.
> I highly recommend creating a backup of your project before using the AI agent.

This AI agent is designed to assist with Android application development within the Android Code Studio environment. While it aims for accuracy, please be aware that AI can occasionally generate code containing errors, suggest outdated practices, or misinterpret complex requirements. I am continuously working to improve its capabilities.

## ✅ Guidelines for Optimal Results

*   **📝 Be Specific:** Clearly define your objective (e.g., "Add a button that opens a new activity").
*   **🧠 Provide Context:** Include relevant code snippets, error messages, or Logcat outputs to help the AI understand your situation.
*   **🚫 Avoid Greetings:** To help the AI respond faster and more accurately, please avoid starting your messages with greetings like "Hi," "Hello," or "Hey." Instead, state your request directly.
*   **🔄 Reset Context After Completion:** Once your request is successfully fulfilled, long-press the send button and perform a *hard reset of the context*. This clears the conversation history and helps the AI start fresh for your next task.

⚡ **Always review and test all generated code thoroughly before building your project.**

***Tip:*** Long-press the send button to manage the AI context.
